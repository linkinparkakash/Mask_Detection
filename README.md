# Mask Detection using YOLOv5 and Flask
This is a Mask Detection project that uses the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm and a Flask web application to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time. The project was created using Google Colab and Python.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app by running the following command:

Copy code
python app.py or main.py
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the app.

# Usage
To use the app, follow these steps:

Click the "Choose File" button and select an image file.

Click the "Predict" button to start the detection process.

Wait for the app to process the file and display the results.

The app will display the input image with bounding boxes around the detected objects. The boxes will have corresponding labels if a mask is detected or no mask is detected.

# Credits
This project was created by Akash Pathania as part of a iNeuron.ai Internship project. The YOLOv5 algorithm was developed by Ultralytics LLC. The Flask web application was created using the Flask framework.
